#Snaju Applicantion Assignment

This is a web app I am creating to demonstrate my abilities to deploy a web based software solution based on requirements.


Task Purpose: To demonstrate your ability to develop a web-based software solution based on
requirements.


Task Restrictions: No library can be used to complete this in-full, you can use helper/utility
libraries (Ex: sorting arrays etc.) and CSS libraries to help build a web application quickly.


Task Description: Use a web facing technology/ language of your choice to develop a TODO list
application that meets the following functional/ non-functional requirements.


Requirements:

    1. Must be runnable in CentOS 7, you will provide setup instructions to test your application.
    2. Must allow a user to create TODO items
    3. Must allow a user to mark a TODO item as complete
    4. Must allow a user to delete TODO items
    5. Must allow a user to clear the TODO list in full
    6. Must persist data between refreshes
    7. The application must be responsive



Use Case: Susan owns a flow shop and wants to use a TODO system that everyone can use from
one computer in her shop to see what there is todo for that day. The system will be updated by
Susan manually every morning and checked throughout the day for completion and the status
of the progress.


To use:


1) The default port is 3000, if you wish to change it go in server.js and change it on line 7.

2)
    $ node server.js
    
3) Visit the address that it displayed in the console.
